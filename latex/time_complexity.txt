These are the steps to solve the ACLP+RPDP with the complexity analysis:

1. Input data

a) Aircraft parameters: O(1)
b) Airports and distances: O(K)

O(1+K) = O(K)

c) Load packed contents and load items from text files are O(m) and O(n), respectively.
This analysis assumes that the operations of reading lines, and processing those lines dominate any fixed overhead from filesystem interactions: O(m + n)

O(K + m + n)

2. Number of tested tours (T):

If K <= 6, determine the number of tours through permutation. To get permutation of nodes as tours has a complexity of O(T = K!⋅K), as the number of nodes is permutated (factorial) to generate tours.

O(K + m + n) + O(T = K!⋅K) or

O(K + m + n) + O(T = 2), if the we are solving the two optimal TSP tours.

If K > 6, we obtain 100 tours from a heuristic TSP solution: O(K + m + n) + O(T = 100)

3. than, solve T tours:

O(K + m + n) + O(T)

a) each tour with has K nodes:

OO(K + m + n) + O(T.K)

b) in each node we have to reset* O(K⋅m) and set the empty pallets destinations: O(K⋅m + K⋅m) = O(2.K.m) = O(K.m)

*eliminate the risk of previous destinations assigned to a pallet.

O(K + m + n) + + O(T.K.(K.m))

c) To calculate the time limit to solve each node, it is necessary to determine the potential total volume for each node: O(K.n)

O(K + m + n) + O(T.K.(K.m + K.n))

d) Put the packet contents destined to the next nodes in the tour on board: O(m).

O(K + m + n) + O(T.K.(K.m + K.n + m))

d) Optimize the pallets positions to minimize the CG deviation: O(m²)

O(K + m + n) + O(T.K.(K.m + K.n + m + m²))

e) Plus the time complexity of the method used to solve an ACLPP with the aircraft partially loaded: O(C)

O(K + m + n) + O(T.K.(K.m + K.n + m + m² + C))

4. Considering the Shims algorithm: O(C) = O(Shims)

a) the time complexity for sorting the pallets in non-descending order of distances to the CG:

O(Shims) = m.log(m)

b) As each pallet is solved at a time, the overall Shims complexity is multiplied by m.

O(Shims) = m.(m.log(m))

c) The greedy phase has O(n).

O(Shims) = m.(m.log(m) + n)

d) The composition phase has O(n), plus the FFD time complexity O(m.log(m))

O(Shims) = m.(m.log(m) + n + n + m.log(m))

O(Shims) = m.(2n + 2.m.log(m)) = m.(n + m.log(m))

The overall time complexity to solve the ACLP+RPDP with Shims is:

O(K+m+n) + O(T.K.(K.m + K.n + m + m² + m.(n + m.log(m))))
