	abstract = {This paper deals with a new extension of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) in which the objective is to maximize the profit per unit time. A travelling salesman has to complete a tour comprised of n cities. The tour starts and ends at one of the cities and must pass through all n cities. There are several travelling options between every pair of cities which differ in their costs and durations. When completing the tour, the travelling salesman will receive a predefined known income. The salesman's profit per unit time is defined as the profit gained after completing the tour (calculated by subtracting the route's costs from the profit) divided by the total time required to complete the tour. This problem is a new practical and more complex extension of the well-studied TSP due to the multiple travelling options. The paper defines the problem and presents an iterative solution procedure, which converges after a limited number of iterations, while each iteration having the same time complexity of solving the classical TSP optimally or heuristically.}

TITLE = {Adding Negative Learning to Ant Colony Optimization: A Comprehensive Study},

ABSTRACT = {Ant colony optimization is a metaheuristic that is mainly used for solving hard combinatorial optimization problems. The distinctive feature of ant colony optimization is a learning mechanism that is based on learning from positive examples. This is also the case in other learning-based metaheuristics such as evolutionary algorithms and particle swarm optimization. Examples from nature, however, indicate that negative learning—in addition to positive learning—can beneficially be used for certain purposes. Several research papers have explored this topic over the last decades in the context of ant colony optimization, mostly with limited success. In this work we present and study an alternative mechanism making use of mathematical programming for the incorporation of negative learning in ant colony optimization. Moreover, we compare our proposal to some well-known existing negative learning approaches from the related literature. Our study considers two classical combinatorial optimization problems: the minimum dominating set problem and the multi dimensional knapsack problem. In both cases we are able to show that our approach significantly improves over standard ant colony optimization and over the competing negative learning mechanisms from the literature.},
