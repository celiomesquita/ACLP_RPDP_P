\item A submissão do nosso artigo revisado atende todas as {\bf Compliance Requirements}.

\end{itemize}


\section{\#2-a: The entire comments made by the Associate Editor}

De acordo com a mensagem recebida, parece-nos que os comentários do Associate Editor são os seguintes:

\vspace{0.5cm}


Reviewers' comments:

\begin{itemize}

\item [1.] More analysis shall be given to discuss the experimental results.
\item [2.] More newly-published related references shall be cited and dicussed in Introduction.
\item [3.] More experiments hope to be added to support the conclusion.
\end{itemize}


\section{\#2-b: Our Point-to-Point responses to the Associate Editor}


\paragraph{Revision:}
More analysis shall be given to discuss the experimental results. 
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Como pode ser observado logo abaixo, aumentamos substancialmente os dados experimentais apresentados. Consequentemente, houve também um sensível aumento na discussão sobre eles.}
		
		{\color{blue}As can be seen below, we have substantially increased the experimental data presented. Consequently, there was also a noticeable increase in discussion about them. Especially about the overall improvement caused by the run time limit proportional to the volumes of items in each node and the additional experiments to validate the best method found.
		}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}



\paragraph{Revision:}
More newly-published related references shall be cited and dicussed in Introduction.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Incluímos e comentamos novas referências (procurar trabalhos recentes sobre TSP e PDP em aeronaves).}
		
		{\color{blue}
		We included the work of \citep{zhao2023}, that developed an air cargo loading plan that addresses the Air Cargo Palletization Problem (ACPP) and the Aircraft Weight and Balance Problem (WBP) separately, impacting payload optimization and aircraft center of gravity (CG). The authors propose three integer linear programming models: a bi-objective optimization model (BOM), a combinatorial optimization model (COM), and an improved combinatorial optimization model (IOM). The models aim to determine the maximum loading capacity and lowest CG deviation from a specified target CG.
		
		The study uses Gurobi to solve four scenarios with various conditional metrics for the three models. Results show that the BOM has the fastest solution speed, but the CG deviation is the largest, making the results unacceptable in some cases. The COM takes too long to solve, making it difficult to meet the needs of the actual scene. The IOM accelerates the solving process, but some scenarios still require significant computation time.	
		}
		
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}



\paragraph{Revision:}
More experiments hope to be added to support the conclusion.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Incluímos novos resultados experimentais (novas figuras, testes, etc.). Concretamente: desempenhos obtidos com outras metaheurísticas; definição empírica de $\eta_1$\/ and $\eta_2$\/ no algoritmo {\it Shims}; limite de tempo variável em cada nó, de acordo com o volume de carga previsto em cada nó; resolução de casos com um maior número de nós}.
		
{\color{blue}
	New experiments were conducted due to two changes suggested by the reviewers:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item [1.] Node solution times depended on the total volume of candidate items to be loaded in each node in relation to the total items volume to be loaded in the tour.
		\item [2.] A new process of determining the {\it Shims} volume thresholds for $eta_1$ and $eta_2$.
	\end{itemize}


	We included Table 10 with the results of the {\it iRace} tool, a software package that helps to automatically fine-tune algorithm parameters. We fine-tuned parameters $threshold_1$\/ and $threshold_2$\/, the relative volumes of each pallet used to determine the indexes  $\eta_1$\/ and $\eta_2$ for the {\it Shims} heuristic.

	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\section{\#3-a: The entire comments made by the Reviewers}

Indicamos a seguir, em cada subseção, os comentários feitos pelos três revisores.

\subsection{Reviewer \#1}

\begin{itemize}

\item [1] In section 2, Literature review in the first and second paragraphs is too simple. Some analysis needs to be given to introduce the research status.

\item [2] In the manuscript, any figures about algorithm simulation results cannot be found. Some figures and analysis are suggested to be presented to show the superiority of the used algorithm.

\item [3] Also, any figures about experiments are not given in the manuscript. "By using a portable computer, our strategy quickly found practical solutions to a wide range of real problems in much less than operationally acceptable time."
Could you please show the results with some figures?

\item [4] Too many old references are cited.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reviewer \#2}

This paper addresses the optimization of air cargo load planning and routing for pickup and delivery operations. It introduces a novel problem called the Air Cargo Load Planning with Routing Pickup and Delivery Problem (ACLP+RPDP), which is mathematically modeled to tackle the challenges of pallet assembly, load balancing, and route planning in air transport.

The problem raised in this paper is innovative and applicable, and the proposed algorithm demonstrates effectiveness in solving the problem. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

\begin{itemize}

\item [1.] The experimental section lacks effectiveness analysis, where the specific contributions of each strategy are not thoroughly verified and analyzed through separate experiments.

\item[2.] The comparative experiment should include both well-known and novel algorithms for a comprehensive evaluation.

\item [3.] The algorithm is missing a complexity analysis, which is essential to better understand its efficiency and potential limitations.

\item [4.] The inclusion of more figures to illustrate the flow, principle, and results of the algorithm would greatly enhance the clarity and visual representation.

\item [5.] The format of the article needs further adjustment, particularly in addressing the existing large blank spaces on pages 7 and 10.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reviewer \#3}

This paper models the ACLP+RPDP of a real case, and develops a problem-solver. The experiments have demonstrated the contributions. However, there are some issues that should be addressed:

\begin{itemize}

\item [1:] In section 1, the authors claim that they solve an air cargo problem involving simultaneously APP, WBP, PDP, and TSP. But, there is not clear description of the importance. In other words, the motivation should be enhanced.

\item [2:] The literature review is simple. Although some studies focus on the same sub-problem in ACLPP, they still show differences in designing modelling and problem-solver. Apparently, authors should supplement them.

\item [3:] In section 5, the running time at each node is fixed. Whether different nodes have different requirements for running time.

\item [4:] In section 5.2.2, $\eta_1$\/ and $\eta_2$\/ are set by authors. It is better to study them by experiments.

\item [5:] The experimental settings are not complete.

\item [6:] To the best of our knowledge, the genetic algorithm is a good method for solving ACLPP. The method is not compared in the experiments.

\item [7:] With the increase of nodes, what impact will be brought in solving the problem. The experiments and analysis should be supplemented.

\end{itemize}




\section{\#3-b: Our Point-to-Point responses to the Reviewers}

Em cada subseção, responderemos os comentários de cada um dos três revisores.


\subsection{Reviewer \#1}

\paragraph{Revision:}
In section 2, Literature review in the first and second paragraphs is too simple. Some analysis needs to be given to introduce the research status.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Aumentamos a revisão da literatura, descrevendo os trabalhos com maior detalhe. Acrescentamos também alguns trabalhos mais recentes. Citar quais são esses trabalhos...}
		
		{\color{blue}
	We included the work of \citep{zhao2023}, that developed an air cargo loading plan that addresses the Air Cargo Palletization Problem (ACPP) and the Aircraft Weight and Balance Problem (WBP) separately, impacting payload optimization and aircraft center of gravity (CG). The authors propose three integer linear programming models: a bi-objective optimization model (BOM), a combinatorial optimization model (COM), and an improved combinatorial optimization model (IOM).

\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
In the manuscript, any figures about algorithm simulation results cannot be found. Some figures and analysis are suggested to be presented to show the superiority of the used algorithm.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Incluímos figuras comparativas, mostrando o melhor desempenho da heurística {\it Shims}. Citar quais são essas figuras...}
		
		{\color{blue}
		We included a map showing a 15-node tour as to validate the effectiveness of the {\it Shims} heuristic, we solve a 15-node TSP containing the 15 main Brazilian airports.
		For this task, we implemented a TSP solution method based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that returns a population of 100 tours as input to the ACLP-RPDP solved by {\it Shims}.
		}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
Also, any figures about experiments are not given in the manuscript. "By using a portable computer, our strategy quickly found practical solutions to a wide range of real problems in much less than operationally acceptable time." Could you please show the results with some figures?
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Nas novas figuras incluídas no artigo, mostramos o desempenho dos algoritmos desenvolvidos. Citar quais são essas figuras...}
		
		{\color{blue}
The GA run time to solve a 15-node TSP was around three seconds, and the total run time (including the ACLP+RPDP solution by Shims) was around 33 seconds, which we believe is adequate for an operational scenario and using a common hand-held computer.

A figure was included showing the solution tour.
	}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
Too many old references are cited.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Incluímos referências mais recentes (citá-las). De qualquer modo, preferimos manter as antigas, para assim termos um levantamento histórico da evolução da pesquisa neste campo.}
		
		{\color{blue}
		We included a more recent reference, \citep{zhao2023}, that demonstrates how hard it is to solve the ACLP and WBP, separately or together.
		
		In any case, we prefer to keep the old ones so that we have a historical survey of the evolution of research in this field.	
		}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\subsection{Reviewer \#2}


\paragraph{Revision:}
The experimental section lacks effectiveness analysis, where the specific contributions of each strategy are not thoroughly verified and analyzed through separate experiments.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Talvez não tenha ficado claro no texto original, mas três estratégias foram imprescindíveis para que pudéssemos obter alguma solução nas instâncias criadas: (1) considerar $K<m$\ para que cada pallet recebesse uma destinação predefinida; (2) em cada tour, calcular uma solução nó a nó; (3) em cada nó intermediário do tour considerado, realocar os packed contents minimizando o torque na aeronave. Sem a adoção destas três estratégias, não conseguimos realizar nenhum experimento, mesmo em instâncias menores. A única estratégia que permitiu diferentes experimentos e comparações foi a heurística utilizada na solução nó a nó. Procuramos deixar isto mais claro na nossa conclusão.}
		
		{\color{blue}
		It may not have been clear in the original text, but three strategies were essential for us to obtain a solution in the instances created:
		
		\begin{itemize}
		\item[(1)] consider $K<m$\ so that each pallet received a predefined destination;
		
		\item[(2)] on each tour, calculate a node-by-node solution; and
		
		\item[(3)] at each intermediate node of the considered tour, relocate the packed contents, minimizing the torque on the aircraft.
		\end{itemize}
		
		Without adopting these three strategies, we were unable to carry out any experiments, even in smaller instances. The only strategy that allowed different experiments and comparisons was the heuristic used in the node-by-node solution. We seek to make this clearer in the discussion of the results and in our conclusion.	
		}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
The comparative experiment should include both well-known and novel algorithms for a comprehensive evaluation.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Como estamos lidando com um novo problema, não dispomos de outras resoluções disponíveis na literatura. Na verdade, temos apenas meta-heurísticas bem conhecidas para a solução nó a nó, no qual o torque da aeronave é minimizado. Por este motivo, incluímos novas tabelas comparativas com os resultados obtidos nesses casos.}
		
		{\color{blue}
		As we are dealing with a new problem, we do not have other solutions available in the literature. In fact, we only have well-known meta-heuristics for the node-to-node solution, in which the aircraft torque is minimized. For this reason, we have included new comparative tables with the results obtained in these cases.	
		}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
The algorithm is missing a complexity analysis, which is essential to better understand its efficiency and potential limitations.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Agradecemos este comentário. Incluímos a análise de complexidade do algoritmo apresentado no nosso artigo.}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
The inclusion of more figures to illustrate the flow, principle, and results of the algorithm would greatly enhance the clarity and visual representation.
\begin{center}

		\textit{Agradecemos esta sugestão. Acrescentamos novas figuras e tabelas que ilustram melhor nossos resultados. Citar quais são...}

\subsection{Reviewer \#3}


\paragraph{Revision:}
In section 1, the authors claim that they solve an air cargo problem involving simultaneously APP, WBP, PDP, and TSP. But, there is not clear description of the importance. In other words, the motivation should be enhanced.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Acrescentamos novas motivações para a resolução do ACLP+RPDP, que envolve simultaneamente 4 sub-problemas {\it NP-hard}.}

\paragraph{Revision:}
The literature review is simple. Although some studies focus on the same sub-problem in ACLPP, they still show differences in designing modelling and problem-solver. Apparently, authors should supplement them.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Agradecemos esta sugestão. Incluímos mais informações na revisão da literatura, indicando as modelagens e os métodos de resolução.}
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
In section 5, the running time at each node is fixed. Whether different nodes have different requirements for running time.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Agradecemos esta sugestão. Entre os novos resultados apresentados, incluímos uma resolução na qual o tempo dedicado a cada nó é proporcional à carga disponível para embarque.}
		{\color{blue}
			
An important experiment inclusion was regarding the time limit to solve a node. This was adjusted to be proportional to the sum of the volumes of the candidate items in the node, as each node has a different number of items to be embarked.

This inclusion certainly contributed to the slight improvement observed in the results.
			
		}
		
	\end{minipage}
\end{center}


\paragraph{Revision:}
In section 5.2.2, $\eta_1$\/ and $\eta_2$\/ are set by authors. It is better to study them by experiments.
\begin{center}
	\begin{minipage}{10cm}
		\textit{Estudamos a viabilidade de definir empiricamente os valores dessas constantes do algoritmo Shims. Explicar...}
		
{\color{blue}
	After the items were generated, some experiments with the \textit{iRace} tool were executed to determine the values for volume limits $threshold_1$ and $threshold_2$ used in \textit{Shims}, whose results are presented in Table \ref{tab:irace}.
	
	\begin{table}[H]
		\centering
		\caption{\textit{iRace} testing results}  \label{tab:irace}

			                 & for $\eta_1$          & for $\eta_2$          & (min) \\
			\midrule
			1.2& 0.8621 & 1.0539 & 47 \\

	\end{table}
	
	For these tests, we considered the odd instances (1, 3, 5, 7) as the \textbf{training} set and the even instances (2, 4, 6) as the \textbf{testing} set for the \textit{iRace} runs. We supplied \textit{iRace} for $threshold_1$ determination, the range [0.8, 1.0], and for $threshold_2$, the range [1.0, 2.0]. The number of iterations in each experiment was limited to 3000 executions for \textit{iRace} to have plenty of data for its statistical tests. More detail about these configurations may be found on the \textit{iRace} user guide in \url{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/irace/irace.pdf}.

	\citep{PeerlinckAmy2022MFEO} applied DEAP to solve a multi-objective knapsack problem.

	Our GA implementation is not complete. Due to performance issues, we did not include the constraints regarding the Weight and Balance (WBP) or the Pickup and Delivery (PDP) problems.
	
	In the first attempt, considering only the weight and volume constraints, our implementation of DEAP managed to solve problems up to 100 items to be allocated to 18 pallets in less than 10 seconds.	
	When we included the item count constraint to prevent each item from being allocated to more than one pallet, it was able to solve only small problems (20 items on 2 pallets).
	
	We increased the number of items to 150, and the number of pallets to 18, but, even adjusting the GA parameters to more generations (2400) and more individuals (1200), DEAP did not generate any feasible solution. The run time of this attempt was around 10 minutes.
	
	For the crossover probability, we tested the range [0.6 - 0.8], and for the mutation probability, we tested from 0.01 to 0.1 with no success.

	The palletization planning of 200 to 1000 items per node in a set of 18 aircraft pallets may be an inadequate problem to be solved with GA.	
		
Large chromosome sizes, like 18,000-dimension arrays, can pose significant challenges in using genetic algorithms.

The computational complexity is significant, as each generation requires evaluating individual fitness, which can be resource-intensive.

Large chromosomes can slow GA convergence due to the vast search space, potentially requiring more generations to find optimal solutions.

Efficient encoding and decoding of the problem into the chromosome and decoding solutions is crucial for a 18,000-dimension array. 
Also, the design of the fitness function becomes more critical as chromosome size increases, as it needs to guide the evolutionary process without being overly computationally demanding.

We hope that these considerations help justify why we did not include GA as a candidate method to solve the ACLP+RPDP.

\paragraph{Revision:}
With the increase of nodes, what impact will be brought in solving the problem. The experiments and analysis should be supplemented.

		\textit{Agradecemos esta sugestão. Incluímos resultados da resolução de casos com um maior número $K$\/ de nós, mantendo a suposição $K < m$, necessária para a definição prévia da destinação dos pallets.

To validate the effectiveness of the {\it Shims} heuristic, we solve a 15-node TSP containing the 15 main Brazilian airports.
For this task, we implemented a TSP solution method based on the Genetic Algorithm (GA) that returns a population of 100 tours as input to the ACLP-RPDP solved by {\it Shims}. The GA run time was around three seconds, and the total run time was around 33 seconds.

We implemented the GA with DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python), an evolutionary computation framework available in \url{https://github.com/deap/deap}. More details can be found in \citep{DEAP_JMLR2012}.
